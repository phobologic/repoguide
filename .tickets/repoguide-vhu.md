# Add Go and Ruby language support

Add Go and Ruby as supported languages for repoguide. Requires: making parse.go language-agnostic, adding tree-sitter queries and language configs for each language, adding tests, and replacing --language flag with --langs for multi-language filtering. See plan at ~/.claude/plans/humming-pondering-quill.md for full details.
